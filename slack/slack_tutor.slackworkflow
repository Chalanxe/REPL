Please read following guidelines to make everyone's experience wonderful:\n\n- *Reply using threads* to keep things neat instead of posting to the channel. :thumbsup:\n- Read the *Programme Regulations* and the *Guidelines for Examinations*: london.ac.uk/sites/default/files/regulations/progregs-computer-science-2019-2020.pdf and london.ac.uk/sites/default/files/examiners/guidelines-for-examinations-2018-19.pdf\n- *Post in the relevant channels*: there is a channel for each module, starting with `#cm`. For example, discrete maths questions should go in <#CKZT2LKPW|cm1020-discrete-math>. Use #askpreviouscohorts or <#CNE7YKNB1|october2019batch> for cohort specific discussion instead of <#CDTPC3FKL|general>.\n- *Make sure a channel doesn't already exist* before creating another one with the same purpose. You can collaborate in a *private group work* by creating a *private channel* instead of a public one.\n- *Curated list of course related resources* here: github.com/world-class/REPL\n- Remember to check the *pinned messages* in each channel: you'll find useful info!\n- *Please do your own research* (Slack, search engine, etc.) before asking a question that has been answered many times. For a start, make sure you have read all the documents you will find on that page: github.com/world-class/REPL#documents-and-resources-provided-publicly-by-the-university-of-london\n- Don't forget the *_Search_ feature* available on Slack (specific keywords, messages from a specific user with *from:@username*, in different channels, by files, within certain dates, etc.). → slack.com/help/articles/202528808-search-in-slack\n- Get in touch with your tutors and SRMs (Student Relationship Managers)! → github.com/world-class/REPL#reaching-out-to-tutors-and-srms\n- Be *nice*, be *respectful*. Don't make jokes or post memes that target a particular gender, religion, nationality or sexuality — we're a global and multicultural community. *Some students may be more sensitive* about certain topics and we certainly *don't want to discriminate* anybody and *don't want to make Slack a hostile environment* in any way.\n- *Do not violate UoL guidelines* (don’t post *illegal* materials, solutions to *graded quizzes* or big *chunks of code* related to any graded assignment).\n- *Refer to specific modules, videos and quizzes by their number* (week and item numbers as shown in Coursera), so that it is easy for future users to look for answers. You'll find a #bugs channel to help you uncover if a bug you have encountered has been documented before: please post to that channel *only once a bug has been identified* as such in another channel.\n- *Thank people* when they help you! :slightly_smiling_face: Despite the distance, we're still humans (most of us, anyways).\n\nWe hope you'll have a great time here! *_Remember that succeeding as a CS student has a lot to do with being able to find answers on your own and sharing them to cement your learning_* :bulb:.\n\nBe well and *welcome* :slightly_smiling_face:!"}},{"type":"dialog","id":"62923c72-5941-4dc8-b9b8-4e457b0d9e7d","config":{"user":{"ref":"b7b1cd80-e7dc-4f05-9bb0-c7971a82f451==user"},"dialog_title":"Onboarding feedback form","dialog_elements":[{"name":"f3999350-a1c0-464d-82c7-096403150e7d","type":"select","label":"Rate your experience.","options":[{"label":"1","value":"1"},{"label":"2","value":"2"},{"label":"3","value":"3"},{"label":"4","value":"4"},{"label":"5","value":"5"}],"optional":false,"data_source":"static"},{"name":"09eacc52-56ef-4229-bb21-31251b00967c","type":"textarea","label":"Please share your feedback if any.","optional":true}],"results_channel":{"value":"CUXANH2MT"},"dialog_submit_label":"","delivery_button_label":"Open Form","delivery_message_text":"You have finished a basic onboarding task created by current students.
